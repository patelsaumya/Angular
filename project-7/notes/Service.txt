Angular Dependency Injector is a Hierarchical Injector.

Service is added to the 'providers' :- (in)

AppModule
  -> Same Instance of Service is available Application-Wide (can be used in other services, directives, components...).
AppComponent
  -> Same Instance of Service is available for all Components (but not for other Services).
Any other Component
  -> Same instance of Service is available for the Component and all its child components (but not for other Services).
     This instance will override if we were to provide the same service on a higher level.


The instances don't propagate up, they only go down the tree of components.
